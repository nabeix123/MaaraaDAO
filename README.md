# MaaraaWeb
- MaaraaDAO is an Anonymous Authentication System for Advertisement Platforms

## Problem Statement
- Current internet infrastructure for advertisements is not protecting privacy. 
- Current internet infrastructure for advertisement is generating partial insights

## Perspective
- Web3 is built on permission-less blockchains with open protocols and open standards.
- Web3 offers a greater level of freedom, decentralization, and democracy for netizens

## Technology
- Integration of MixNet Implementation in Rust ( https://github.com/nvotes/braid )
- Integration of ZKP Implementation on Substrate ( https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/ZKRollups )
- Intergation of ERC20 - Substrate Bridge ( https://github.com/akropolisio/erc20-substrate-bridge )

## Inspiration
- Maaraa is the dravidian god of ancient species and spectres ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ra )
- The web 3.0 is also known as the “Semantic”,  thanks to semantic metadata for connectivity at large.
